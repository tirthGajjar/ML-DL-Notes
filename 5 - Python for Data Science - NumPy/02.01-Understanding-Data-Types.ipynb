    "Effective data-driven science and computation requires understanding how data is stored and manipulated.\n",
    "<span class=\"mark\">This section outlines and contrasts how arrays of data are handled in the Python language itself, and how NumPy improves on this</span>.\n",
    "Understanding this difference is fundamental to understanding much of the material throughout the rest of the book.\n",
    "\n",
    "Users of Python are often drawn-in by its ease of use, one piece of which is dynamic typing.\n",
    "While a statically-typed language like C or Java requires each variable to be explicitly declared, a dynamically-typed language like Python skips this specification. For example, in C you might specify a particular operation as follows:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "/* C code */\n",
    "int result = 0;\n",
    "for(int i=0; i<100; i++){\n",
    "    result += i;\n",
    "}\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "While in Python the equivalent operation could be written this way:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Python code\n",
    "result = 0\n",
    "for i in range(100):\n",
    "    result += i\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice <span class=\"girk\">the main difference: in C, the data types of each variable are explicitly declared, while in Python the types are dynamically inferred.</span> This means, for example, that we can assign any kind of data to any variable:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "# Python code\n",
    "x = 4\n",
    "x = \"four\"\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "Here we've switched the contents of ``x`` from an integer to a string. The same thing in C would lead (depending on compiler settings) to a compilation error or other unintented consequences:\n",
    "\n",
    "```C\n",
    "/* C code */\n",
    "int x = 4;\n",
    "x = \"four\";  // FAILS\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "This sort of flexibility is one piece that makes Python and other dynamically-typed languages convenient and easy to use.\n",
    "Understanding *how* this works is an important piece of learning to analyze data efficiently and effectively with Python.\n",
    "But what <span class=\"girk\">this type-flexibility also points to is the fact that Python variables are more than just their value; they also contain extra information about the type of the value.</span> We'll explore this more in the sections that follow."

For example, <span class=\"mark\">when we define an integer in Python, such as ``x = 10000``, ``x`` is not just a \"raw\" integer. It's actually a pointer to a compound C structure, which contains several values</span>.\n",
    "Looking through the Python 3.4 source code, we find that the integer (long) type definition effectively looks like this (once the C macros are expanded):\n",

    "\n",
    "A single integer in Python 3.4 actually contains four pieces:\n",
    "\n",
    "- <span class=\"mark\">``ob_refcnt``, a reference count that helps Python silently handle memory allocation and deallocation</span>\n",
    "- <span class=\"mark\">``ob_type``, which encodes the type of the variable</span>\n",
    "- <span class=\"mark\">``ob_size``, which specifies the size of the following data members</span>\n",
    "- <span class=\"mark\">``ob_digit``, which contains the actual integer</span> value that we expect the Python variable to represent.\n",
